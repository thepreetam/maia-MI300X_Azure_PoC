# Code Review Request: Maia Fractal Codec Baseline Implementation

Dear Technical Review Team,

I am requesting a focused code review of our baseline fractal implementation for the Maia Fractal Codec project. This implementation represents the foundational building block of our quantum-ready video codec optimized for AMD MI350X accelerators on Azure.

## Current Implementation Scope:
- Basic fractal encoding kernel implemented in Verilog
- Azure NDv5 deployment infrastructure
- Initial benchmarking framework
- CI/CD pipeline for testing

## Primary Ask:
We need expert validation of our fractal kernel implementation to ensure it provides a solid foundation for our quantum-ready architecture. Specifically, we'd like feedback on:

**Efficiency of our fractal encoding approach on the MI350X architecture** - Our initial design targets a 67% performance improvement over the Xilinx baseline, with a goal of achieving 0.3ms latency for 4K processing by Q3 2025. We'd appreciate your assessment of whether our approach can fully leverage the CDNA 4 architecture's capabilities, particularly its Fractal ISA extensions and quantum-ready features.

The project began in January 2025, and we're currently in the initial implementation phase. Your early feedback will be invaluable in guiding our development efforts and ensuring we're on the right track to meet our performance targets and prepare for quantum-classical hybrid workloads.

Thank you for your expertise and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
