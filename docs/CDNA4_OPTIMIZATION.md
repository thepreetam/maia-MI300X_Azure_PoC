# CDNA 4 Architecture Optimization

This document outlines the specific optimizations planned for AMD's CDNA 4 architecture in the MI350X accelerator to achieve the target 0.5ms latency for 4K fractal encoding.

## Architecture Overview

The AMD MI350X features the CDNA 4 architecture with the following key components:

- 384GB HBM4 memory with 8TB/s bandwidth
- 64MB SRAM for coefficient caching
- Fractal ISA Extensions
- Matrix Core 4.0
- Photonic Interconnects (8Tbps)
- CXL 3.0 support
- 0.9W/4K frame power efficiency

## Memory Hierarchy Optimizations

### HBM4 and SRAM Utilization

The MI350X's 384GB of HBM4 memory and 64MB SRAM provide a significant advantage for our fractal encoding workload. We plan to implement the following optimizations:

1. **Coefficient Caching**: Store frequently used fractal coefficients in SRAM
   - Expected to reduce memory access latency by 85%
   - Projected to improve throughput by 60%

2. **Memory Banking**: Distribute fractal data across multiple HBM4 banks
   - Will enable parallel memory access
   - Expected to reduce bank conflicts by 90%

3. **Prefetching**: Implement intelligent prefetching for fractal patterns
   - Projected to reduce cache misses by 80%
   - Expected to improve memory bandwidth utilization by 45%

### Memory Access Patterns

```cpp
// Original memory access pattern (Xilinx)
for (int i = 0; i < blockSize; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < blockSize; j++) {
        output[i][j] = transform(input[i][j]);
    }
}

// Planned optimization for CDNA 4 using Fractal ISA
#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)
for (int i = 0; i < blockSize; i += VECTOR_WIDTH) {
    for (int j = 0; j < blockSize; j += VECTOR_WIDTH) {
        // Use native fractal instructions
        vfractalcompress(&input[i][j], &output[i][j], VECTOR_WIDTH);
    }
}
```

## Compute Optimizations

### Matrix Core 4.0 Utilization

The MI350X's Matrix Core 4.0 with Fractal ISA extensions are designed for efficient fractal operations:

1. **Affine Transformation Batching**: Process multiple affine transformations simultaneously
   - Expected to increase matrix core utilization by 90%
   - Projected to reduce instruction overhead by 50%

2. **Wavefront Execution**: Implement wavefront scheduling for fractal rendering
   - Expected to improve CU occupancy by 85%
   - Projected to reduce idle time by 70%

### Kernel Fusion

```cpp
// Original separate kernels (Xilinx)
void edge_detection(input, edges);
void coordinate_extraction(edges, coordinates);
void fractal_transform(coordinates, transformed);
void render(transformed, output);

// Planned fused kernel for CDNA 4
void fused_fractal_pipeline(input, output) {
    // Shared memory for intermediate results
    __shared__ edge_buffer, coord_buffer, transform_buffer;
    
    // Pipeline stages with synchronization
    edge_detection(input, edge_buffer);
    __syncthreads();
    coordinate_extraction(edge_buffer, coord_buffer);
    __syncthreads();
    // Use native fractal instructions
    vfractaltransform(coord_buffer, transform_buffer);
    __syncthreads();
    render(transform_buffer, output);
}
```
