# MI300X Integration Guide

## AMD MI300X Optimization Pathway  
- **Step 1**: Port Xilinx FPGA kernel to CDNA 3 using ROCm 6.0.  
- **Step 2**: Leverage MI300X's 192GB HBM3 for fractal coefficient caching.  
- **Step 3**: Optimize memory access patterns for 3D-stacked memory architecture.
- **Milestone**: Target 0.5ms latency by Q3 2025 (vs. 0.9ms on Xilinx).  

## Technical Deep Dive

### CDNA 3 Architecture Advantages

The AMD MI300X accelerator offers significant advantages for our fractal encoding workload:

1. **HBM3 Memory**: 192GB of high-bandwidth memory with 5.3TB/s bandwidth
2. **Matrix Cores**: 304 compute units with 4,864 matrix cores
3. **Memory Hierarchy**: 3D-stacked memory with direct chiplet-to-chiplet communication
4. **ROCm Support**: Full support for HIP programming model

### Porting Strategy

#### Phase 1: Initial Port (Q1-Q2 2025)
- Convert Xilinx HLS to HIP/ROCm
- Implement basic memory management
